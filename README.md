# fullstackopen

Repository where I store my work while working through fullstackopen.com's course.
Each part is stored in an individual folder. In general, if exercises of the course overwrite previous exercises, the earlier exercise solution is available within the commit history.

Aside from part1 and a bit of part2, I've completed the parts using Typescript instead of Javascript, where possible.

## Running The Code

- Clone the full directory
- move into whichever part you want to run using `cd part$`
- run `npm install`
- `npm start`
