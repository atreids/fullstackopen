# fullstackopen

Repository where I store my work while working through fullstackopen.com's course.
Each part is stored in an individual folder. In general, if exercises of the course overwrite previous exercises, the earlier exercise solution is available within the commit history.


## Running The Code

- Clone the full directory
- move into whichever part you want to run using `cd part$`
- run `npm install`
- `npm start`
